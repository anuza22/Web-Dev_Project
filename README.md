# Kitap.Al

Kitap.Al is an online platform designed to enhance the book purchasing and reading experience for users. With features such as book ratings, categorization, recommendations, notifications, and user reviews, Book Fest aims to provide a comprehensive solution for book enthusiasts.

## How it Works

Book Fest employs an innovative rating system to highlight the most popular books across various categories. Users can explore different genres, receive personalized book recommendations, and stay updated with notifications about new releases or promotions. Additionally, users have the opportunity to contribute by writing reviews for books they've read, which can be liked and evaluated by other users. When a review accumulates a certain number of likes, the author receives a one-time discount code for their future book purchases. Furthermore, there are restrictions in place to ensure that the discount applies only to the category of books for which the review was written.
